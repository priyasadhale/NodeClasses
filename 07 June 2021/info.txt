Modules in Node.js
Every file is a Module in Node.js
Modules are the code that forms a library or used frequently.
the members of module have to be exported to the world before its usage.

There are 3 types of modules:
a) File based modules/ User defined modules
b) Core modules/ built-in module: fs, path, os
c) Third party - given by others, need to install using "npm install <module_name>
